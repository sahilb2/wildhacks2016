# WildHacks NSFW Image Blocker using Clarifai API

**Summary**:
We used the [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/api) in order to create a Google Chrome extension which blocks NSFW images. We used multiple different Clarifai API models and hundreds of pictures in order to train the Clarifai API to detect NSFW pictures accurately and with higher precision. 

**Inspiration**:
Creating a chrome extension which can block NSFW images will help tons of people from fraudulent websites and make their internet experience better overall.

**What it does**:
Blocks NSFW images and learns what a user considers NSFW (through the Clarifai API) in order to create a safe online search environment.

**How we built it**:
We used the Clarifai API and trained it with hundreds of onlines pictures to give us an accurate representation of which pictures are NSFW and which pictures are not.

**Challenges we ran into**:
We had a huge problem connecting our Chrome extension to the Clarifai API since one used Javascript and the other was written in Python.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**:
We are proud of the purpose of our project, to make online browsing a safe environment for everyone.

**What we learned**:
We learned about Chrome development and learned how to quickly deploy our extensions to solve problems.

**What's next for NSFW Blocker**:
We will try to grow our NSFW Blocker to take into account videos and gifs which might be suspicious.
